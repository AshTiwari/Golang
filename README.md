# Golang
This repository contains my notes for Golang.


## Introduction:
- It is strong and statically typed.
- Strong typed: Operations performed on a variable must match it's type.
- e.g. a = "1" + 
- Statically Typed: The type of integer should be defined at compile time and should not change.
- Once an integer, always an integer.


`Note: Even when it is strong and statically typed like Java, it is less verbose than Java.`
